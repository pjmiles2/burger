# burger

This app uses MySQL to store a list of burgers entered by the user. When a user enters a burger name, it is displayed on the left as an available burger. When they click "Eat Me!" the MySQL database is updated and the burger is counted as consumed. The burger is then listed on the right side.

NPM modules used: MySQL, express, express-handlebars, body-parser.
